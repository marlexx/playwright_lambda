# playwright_lambda
 This repo was used to create and test the test scripts for the Lambdatest Playwright 101 exam.

 The "tests" folder contains all 3 test scenarios and can be run by typing "npx playwright test" in the console from here.

 The "lambdatest js scripts" folder contains all 3 test scenarios for the lambdatest-sample clone repo.
 They can be run after cloning the https://github.com/LambdaTest/playwright-sample/ repo, running the "npm install" command and copying the files from the folder to the root of the clone.
 The tests can then be run on the lambdatest platform by running the "node Test_Scenario1.js", "node Test_Scenario2.js" and "node Test_Scenario3.js" commands.

For some reason the .gitpod.yml file did nothing it was told to do so you may need to run these commands before running tests on gitpod: "npm playwright install", "npm install" and "npx playwright install-deps"
Maybe you can help me with this, if you have the time of course.
